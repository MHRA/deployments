# Manifests relating to the Medicines API

This dir contains the compiled manifests for the Medicines API application. The source configuration lives in the [Products monorepo](https://github.com/MHRA/products/manifests/medicines-api) and any updates should be made there.

The configuration in this directory is automatically updated as the result of CI and release workflows and should not be edited directly.
